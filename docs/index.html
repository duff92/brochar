<p>Brings the concept of an Advent Calendar to a new level with Augmented Reality and Interactive content.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-yulecalendar-">What is YuleCalendAR ?</h2>
<p>YuleCalendAR is an application that creates an interactive Advent Calender (“Julkalender”) where you in each hatch get a surprise that could be to get a glimpse of a virtual world through a window or even pop out from the wall! The application is run on your smartphone.</p>

<p>[video]</p>

<p>The current prototype shows three hatches of different types:
* Window to another world (Image)
* Interactive content (Image)
* Virtual objects that “pops out” from the tracker.(Image)</p>

<p>Even if the developed prototype only has three hatches it shows an interesting concept where you can place/choose targets in different locations to encourage people to explore new and interesting locations. As the “Home page” in the application shows.</p>

<h2 id="technologies">Technologies</h2>
<p>The application is developed in Unity.</p>

<p>It makes use of Vuforia image (link to: https://www.vuforia.com/) image recognition to be able to Augument the Reality seen through you smartphones camera.</p>
